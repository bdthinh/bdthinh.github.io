  <p>I am a research assistant in computational linguistics at University of Science, Vietnam. My research interests primarily include formal semantics, pragmatics, phonology, mathematical and computational linguistics. I also enjoy machine learning solutions, MAC, and cuisine.

	This is my personal blog, where I write about any random thing that I love and I do. Indeed, I hope that help your knowledge.</p>
